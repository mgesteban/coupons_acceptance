# coupons_acceptance
Data analysis project investigating factors that influence drivers' decisions to accept location-based mobile coupons for restaurants, bars, and coffee houses during various driving scenarios.

# Problem Statement

## Primary Question
**What factors determine whether a driver will accept a mobile coupon delivered to their phone while driving?**

## Specific Problem
When location-based coupons are delivered to drivers' mobile phones for nearby venues (restaurants, bars, coffee houses), we need to understand which factors influence their decision to:
- Accept and use the coupon immediately ("right away")
- Accept and use the coupon later (before expiration)  
- Reject the coupon entirely

## Business Context
While proximity triggers coupon delivery, acceptance rates vary significantly. Understanding the key drivers of acceptance behavior will enable more effective targeted marketing and higher redemption rates.
