# coupons_acceptance
Data analysis project investigating factors that influence drivers' decisions to accept location-based mobile coupons for restaurants, bars, and coffee houses during various driving scenarios.

# Problem Statement

## Primary Question
**What factors determine whether a driver will accept a mobile coupon delivered to their phone while driving?**

## Specific Problem
When location-based coupons are delivered to drivers' mobile phones for nearby venues (restaurants, bars, coffee houses), we need to understand which factors influence their decision to:
- Accept and use the coupon immediately ("right away")
- Accept and use the coupon later (before expiration)  
- Reject the coupon entirely

## Business Context
While proximity triggers coupon delivery, acceptance rates vary significantly. Understanding the key drivers of acceptance behavior will enable more effective targeted marketing and higher redemption rates.

## Key Questions to Answer

### User Demographics
- How do age, gender, income, education, and marital status affect coupon acceptance?
- Does having children influence the decision?

### Venue Type
- Are acceptance rates different for:
 - Restaurants (under $20)
 - Restaurants ($20-$50)
 - Coffee houses
 - Bars
 - Carry out & take away

### Contextual Factors
- **Weather Impact**: How do sunny, rainy, or snowy conditions affect acceptance?
- **Time of Day**: Are coupons more likely to be accepted at 10AM, 2PM, or 6PM?
- **Temperature**: Does temperature (30°F, 55°F, 80°F) influence decisions?
- **Destination**: How does the driving destination (home, work, no urgent destination) impact acceptance?
- **Passengers**: Does acceptance vary when driving:
 - Alone
 - With partner
 - With children
 - With friends

### Lifestyle Habits
- Do frequent visitors to bars/restaurants/coffee houses accept more coupons?
- Does takeout frequency predict coupon acceptance?

### Special Scenarios
- Will drivers accept bar coupons with minors in the car?
- How does coupon expiration time (2 hours vs. 1 day) affect urgency?

## Goal
Identify the most significant factors that predict coupon acceptance to enable better customer segmentation and targeted coupon delivery strategies.
